GM all. Although we are still trying to batch all payloads until the end of the month, the one from this week can unfortunately not wait. It is a BAL and USDC transfer to Cantina for the upcoming Balancer V3 review contest starting next week. Funds need to be received on their end before Oct 15th. Please sign asap :)
