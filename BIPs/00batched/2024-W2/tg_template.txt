gm.  Happy holidays to all.  Wasn't planning to run this week, but we're runing low on gas and may need the ETH from BIP-514(Maxi Funding) here to keep things running without a scramble to scrape up gas money this week.  Lots of transfers due to SP funding BIPs.

Sorry I didn't get a BIP together for BAL payouts this week, will be included in next weeks voting, perhaps along with the need not to vote on it every time like other regular funding situatuions such as Karpatkey or Beets.
