GM all. As I explained in the messages above.  We need to lock our vlAURA before Thursday this week or we miss out on a 2 week Epoch of BD incentives.   Everyone is on red alert right now re signer security.  The paylaod above has been reviewed already by a number of people for a few PCs, and we will be closley monitoring the signing process.

If you feel safu/comfortable signing right now.  Please do so promptly so we can get this done.  If not, that's fine.  If this slips it's not the end of the world.
