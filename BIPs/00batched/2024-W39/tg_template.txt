Hello again.  Gosuto and I are working hard to batch payloads till the end of the month.  Hope to pester less often. Goal will be to only call on this group at the end of each Month unless there is something really urghent.  We are trying to be more strict about what urgent is now.

Note that there are lots of fund transfers of decent sums this round.  This mostly due to 6 months of funding for a number of Balancer SPs (see below).
